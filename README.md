# MultiPlatformBleAdapter

Middle layer between crossplatform BLE libraries ([react-native-ble-plx](https://github.com/Polidea/react-native-ble-plx)
 and [FlutterBleLib](https://github.com/Polidea/FlutterBleLib)) and iOS/Android system for manipulating Bluetooth Low Energy peripherals.
Internally uses:
* [RxAndroidBle](https://github.com/Polidea/RxAndroidBle)
* [RxBluetoothKit](https://github.com/Polidea/RxBluetoothKit) 
 
If you'd like to use it in your own library, you should start from BleAdapter on either platform.
